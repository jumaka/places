# Places

A repository of GeoJSON extracts of location information for various companies scraped from their sites. 
Inspired by [KAFF Places](https://gitlab.com/KAFF/places).

Using similar principles that if [schema.org](https://schema.org/) style data is available then this
information is available for reuse.

The primary purpose for me is to help validate information on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) using the principles described on Rob Whittaker's [Chain Reaction](https://osm.mathmos.net/chains/) site.

The copyright for this data lies with the original companies.
